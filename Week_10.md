## Content Insights

Backing up a Wordpress site is the best way to protect your site and is important. Although there are many plugins available to secure the site, the most popular is called UpdraftPlus. Once a site has been backed up and exported, you can use the backup files to to get everything back up and running again. Of course, this only works if you are consistently backing up either regularly (eg. after every edit made) or after a significant section has been completed. 

Not only can you protect your site from plugins and backups, you can also ensure your site security by having strong passwords, logging out of the account, controlling site access with permissions and two-step authentication.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning about wordpress security has been insightful from a student point of view but I don't believe this will serve me in my career. Instead, I will provide my overall learning insights and employability for the group project and the subject - as per a rephrase of a section from my LinkedIn Report. 

I experienced significant personal growth, particularly in leadership, time management, and decision-making. Encountering obstacles provided important learning opportunities, reinforcing my adaptability and resilience in high-pressure environments.

Reflecting on this experience, I have enhanced and developed a skill set that will position me as a valuable asset for a career in the IT industry, particularly in my desired field of project management.
