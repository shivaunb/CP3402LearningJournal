## Content Insights

PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor, and is a versatile scripting language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including email and process online forms and upload files from a webpage etc. Usually PHP is used with MySQL databases and the filename extension that is used is .php for all webpages within the site, even if they don't contain PHP code. 

The PHP files works alongside the css file and it is important to have the server root folders set up appropriately so that PHP script can be run and viewed in a browser. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

From the research I completed, I learned that proficiency in PHP Storm is a highly sought after skill by lots of IT companies. It provides experience in a new language and also the skills that come along with languages such as problem solving, debugging and learning how to read and interpret code. I am not sure if this is a skill that I will require in the future within my career, however having experience in this IDE may help me to obtain positions and will increase my employability.
