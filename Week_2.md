## Content Insights

During my research, I discovered that Docker serves as a local host, but there are also online options available for using Joomla without the need for local hosting. Additionally, I found that AWS Lightsail is a hosting platform capable of hosting Joomla content and that there are many online shops offering numerous Joomla templates that can be customized to meet the specific needs and requirements of a website. Exploring and understanding more about CMS like Joomla and Wordpress showed me how popular they actually are and highlighted their practicality for people with limited coding experience.

I researched the example start up links provided in assignment one and learnt that a start up is different from just creating another local business page as start ups are 'an entrepreneurial venture or a new business designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model'.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning how to use Markdown proved to be incredibly valuable this week, especially in my professional role when experimenting with booking form software. Having already researched the basics and knowing the best resources for markdown requirements enabled me to complete my tasks efficiently. Additionally, I am currently undertaking training and practical tasks using Squiz Matrix CMS for my independent project (CP3103) within my workplace, allowing me to apply and comprehend CMS principles in a practical setting. Although Squiz Matrix is a paid product and therefore unavailable for this assessment, the skills I am acquiring are transferable to the CMS we are utilising.

Through online resources and trial-and-error methods, I gained a foundational understanding of Joomla, including creating pages, uploading and modifying templates, establishing navigation, and inserting content. This process proved to be more complex than initially anticipated, underscoring the challenges faced by individuals with limited experience in web development.
