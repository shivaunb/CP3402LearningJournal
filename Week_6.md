## Content Insights

A daily stand up is a crucial teamwork tool to monitor and indicate the progress of a self-organised team project - it is best done whilst actually physically standing and usually lasts approx 5-10 minutes (no more than 15 minutes). If anyone is virtually joining, having them turn on their camera is highly recommended. 

It is a way to keep track of what tasks team members worked on in the previous day, are working on today and any issues that they are having. Having stand up meetings alongside using a project management tool such as trello helps to visualise the tasks and processes that are being discussed and can also draw attention to details such a due dates and completion rates. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning the teamwork skills involved in project management such as daily stands up will be essential for my anticipated future career and I envision that they will be a tool used often. Learning how to communicate effectively but also within a set limit time is a skill that I can improve as being clear and concise, and selecting the appropriate material to share, can sometimes be harder than it appears when completing a large project. Learning how to use and incorporate the project management tool Trello within the assignment will provide experience in project management planning and keeping track of my own tasks, whilst also keeping other team members accountable for theirs. Being able to practice and use these each week means that I will be more confident (and employable) when I applying for project management roles.
