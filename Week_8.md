### Learning Experiment Hypothesis

I hypothesise that incorporating visual learning techniques will enhance my understanding of custom WordPress theme development concepts compared to relying solely on text-based resources.

### Learning Experiment Test

In order to see how well this worked, I decided to split my week in half and so I spent the first half of the week purely just reading text without visuals (no videos, images etc). For the second half of the week I incorporated videos and allowed myself to search up images and visual examples.  

### Learning Experiment Results

What I found was at the beginning of the week when I was only reading text I was bored, found it hard to pay attention and take information in. I only managed to spend an hour learning because of this short attention span. Once I incorporated visuals half way through the week, I had a much better learning experience and was able to watch videos and actually learn and take information in. I think being a week where learning theme development, text only was not a strategy that encouraged learning.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This weeks learning experiment highlighted the value of diverse learning strategies in enhancing employability skills, emphasising the importance of incorporating visual learning methods for career advancement in fields like web development. I rediscovered that my learning strength is visual learning and that I do well from being able to see and copy rather than read or listen. This will help me to answer job interview questions in which I can highlight this and utilise it as a strength.
