## Content Insights

I revisited the importance of identifing user needs when it comes to web design and how important it is to take into consideration what the user cares about that this is done by creating user personas. 

I learned about the three-track process which consists of content creation and curation, graphic and user experience design, and front and backend development. This allows for a smoother and more agile process and can help in avoiding problems and conflicts. 

Retouched on the basic workflow of working with version control and how it can be applied to different fields of computer science/technology. Learnt about branches and the video referred to it as a "separate line of work, or experimentation" and that if a branch is correct it can be merged otherwise it can be disregarded if it is not useful to the overall project. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I have only used version control on my own in solo projects and not in a group setting (yet). I learnt about how repositories work when hosted on servers and shared amongst a group working on the same task. I also learnt that branching is a convenient habit to get into when doing group work as this won't affect the final product and can be merged if all members are in agreeance. 

I think that learning version control is important skill to be able to master and take into real world employment opportunites. I think that in all fields of IT, version control is integrated in one way or another and being competent in this will not only improve my resume, but will also allow me to be a proactive team member.
