## Content Insights

That a child theme is designed to modify an already existing theme (the parent theme). I learned that Wordpress will firstly load up a parent theme before loading the child theme so any modifications only show in the child theme and are not across both. I learned that it is a combination of a css style sheet and a function php document that come together to create and apply the child theme that has been specifically created.  


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This weeks learning about child themes was interesting when getting to learn how they worked, however as I don't intend to follow a path in web design I don't think I will be using this in the future. That aside, learning how to make sure that the codes and documents work together appropriately, and the problem solving skills required to do that are both key skills that I can take with me from this week and into my professional life.
