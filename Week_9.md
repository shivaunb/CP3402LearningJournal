## Content Insights

Sass is an extension that enhances CSS and can also be utilised in a workflow with gulp. Sass is a pre-processed language and therefore cannot be interpreted by browsers correctly, hence the need to translate it to css in order for it to be readable by html. Sass expands the capabilities of CSS and can utilise techniques and features including variables, nesting, partials, extend, operators and mix ins which allow Sass to enhance the flexibility of CSS. The file format of a Sass document is .scss and is kept within the directory of the project. There is also a feature that allows you to watch your scss file, which means that when the input .scss file is updated, it automatically compiles to the output .css file. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning how to use Sass effectively is a tool that can be used to advance in a career in web development. As this is not a career path I am looking at following, learning how to install the programs and use the command line to integrate and download the relevant programs has still allowed me to practice my terminal skills and gain a better understanding. This week also gave me further insight and understanding to workflows and how they are required and utilised in web develpment. Sass combined previous skills in coding and web design so it was interesting to see how they worked together and could be used in this way to create more flexible designs.
