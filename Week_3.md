## Content Insights

This weeks learning gave me insight on the best features to look for when choosing a host service - scalability, security, automatic backup potential and restrictions. 

I also learnt that plug ins are a great way to add features to a website, however when choosing a plug in, to keep in mind that if you are using free ones there is the possiblity that the developer may not maintain or update this and if creating a professional site, using paid plug ins with reliable developers is the best way to go. 

Another helpful insight was that all multimedia should not be uploaded directly into wordpress - it should go through a streaming platform and be embedded into a wordpress block (helpful hint for my assignment).

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Results of Interview questions:

Dayne:
Do you like face-to-face group meetings, online or either? Online then face to face - allows flexibility

Do you like to take initiative with completing tasks or would you prefer to have tasks allocated to you? Either - depends on the situation. 
What are your top group work expectations? "giving a s***" 

Mia:
Do you like face-to-face meetings, online or either? Face to face is better to get work done quicker but online is more convenient
Do you like to take initiative with completing tasks or would you prefer to have tasks allocated to you? Don't mind both, fine with taking initiative and finding own tasks
What are your top group work expectations? Everyone contributes evenly, work gets done on time 

The learnings I gained from the round-robin interviews included realising that everyone has different strengths and expectations when it comes to group work. A common theme that appeared is that despite the technology resources that are available, people still prefer to work face-to-face where possible and use technology as a secondary resource which aligns well with my values as I feel the same way. 

From an employability point of view, I believe having skills in both face-to-face and online communication is valuable to have as it is important with hybrid workplaces which have work from home flexibility - I can see myself working in one in my future IT career.
