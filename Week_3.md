Mia:
Do you like face-to-face meetings, online or either? Face to face is better to get work done quicker but online is more convenient
Do you like to take initiative with completing tasks or would you prefer to have tasks allocated to you? Don't mind both, fine with taking initiative and finding own tasks
What are your top group work expectations? Everyone contributes evenly, work gets done on time 

The learnings I gained from the round-robin interviews included realising that everyone has different strengths and expectations when it comes to group work. A common theme that appeared is that despite the technology resources that are available, people still prefer to work face-to-face where possible and use technology as a secondary resource which aligns well with my values as I feel the same way. 

From an employability point of view, I believe having skills in both face-to-face and online communication is valuable to have as it is important with hybrid workplaces which have work from home flexibility - I can see myself working in one in my future IT career.
