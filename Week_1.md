# Week 1 - Learning Journal CP3402

## Learning Activities & Resources

Firstly, I spent a large amount of time learning about the requirements of the subject by going through all of the resources in LearnJCU and the github page for the subject. I found various helpful internet sites whilst researching the recommended resources provided to us.

I watched the weekly linked in video provided, as well as the pre-recorded lecture videos and as the seminar was not live on blackboard collaborate (I unfortunately didn't realise but will attend in person this week), I watched back the external recording and asked for notes from friends in the class. 

By using the revision quiz and by going back through resources and assignments from CP1406, I re-learnt the basics of html so that I had a solid base to build off for this subject. 

I read up on Markdown and learnt how to use this through the creation of a template for my weekly learning journal.

## Content Insights

As I had very minimal prior knowledge of development and deployment workflows, I spent a large amount of time making sure I understood the basics. As many of the resources recommended were foreign to me, it took a while for me to grasp what each did and how they all worked together. After my research, I downloaded github desktop to work in and chose to use github pages to publish my website which was written in VS code. As I own an Apple Mac, I learnt that Vagrant was not compatible and it for this reason that I have downloaded Docker and begun practicing. I also chose docker my research outlined that the use of containers are not only easy to use as a beginner, but are also consistent and portable for sharing which I believe could be useful with the group assignments.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I chose to move forward with github pages in this first prac as I learnt it was the simplest way to host a static site due to being familiar with github itself. 
Before completing the practical I searched up a LinkedIn Learning Course video on what is github pages and how to use it so that I could have an understanding before completing the practical. 

Making sure I have an understanding of what I'm going to do, prior to beginning the task reiterates the skills of time efficiency and attention to detail which are important in real world situations, especially when time restrictions are a factor. Although I am not entirely aware if github pages is something I will need to use in the future, it is still a good resource to be familiar with and the learnings acquired from it could possibly be an attractive skill set to an employer.
